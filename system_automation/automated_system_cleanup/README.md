- `automated_system_cleanup.bat`: Windows batch script to run the Python script on Windows.
- `automated_system_cleanup.sh`: Unix-based shell script to run the Python script on Linux and macOS.

## Usage

### Python Script

To run the system cleanup using the Python script, execute the following command in your terminal:

```bash
python automated_system_cleanup.py
```

### Windows Batch Script

For Windows users, double-click `automated_system_cleanup.bat` to execute the cleanup process.

### Unix-based Shell Script

For Unix-based systems (Linux, macOS), open a terminal, navigate to the directory containing the scripts, and run the following command to make the shell script executable:

```bash
chmod +x automated_system_cleanup.sh
```

Then, execute the cleanup process with double-click or using:
